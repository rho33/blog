# Biggest Takeaways
- Ideas, trends, products, messages, behaviors... spread like viruses/epidemics.
    - These things can grow at seemingly insignificant rates until they reach a tipping point where significant change happens all at once (like a geometric progression)
- Law of the Few - trends rely on small groups of people to become popular (Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen).
    - Connectors - people that have many weak ties to other people from various backgrounds
    - Mavens - information brokers who share and trade what they know
    - Salesmen - extremely charismatic people who have persusasive influenc over others buying decisions and behaviors
- The Stickiness Factor - the quality that compels people to pay close, sustained attention to a product, concept, or idea.
- The Power of Context - properties of and changes to the environment can greatly influence whether an idea will tip
    - broken windows theory
    - rule of 150 (Dunbar's number)
- Afterword ideas (written some years after the book)
    - The Rise of Isolation - In some/many ways the modern economy allows communities to become more isolated from one another and communities with higher degrees of isolation become are more susceptible to contagious messages.
    - Immunity - overexposure to a communication method/network (e.g. phone, email) eventually makes people less responsive to messages delivered by the given method/network (and more reliant on other methods such as face to face interaction)
	- Mavens become more important as immunity builds to other forms of communication. It also isn't as easy to identify mavens as it is connectors and salesmen.
         - maven traps - strategies to identify and/or influence mavens

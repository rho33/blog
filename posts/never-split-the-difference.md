# Never Split the Difference
by Chris Voss

### High level takeaways from this book:  
- Slow down. Use mirroring and voice tonality to make your counterparts feel safe enough to talk about what they want
- Detect the other person's emotional state, then label it aloud with "It seems/sounds/looks like..." statements. Then be silent and listen.
- Identify and deal with counterfeit "yes" answers.
- Be patient and use creativity to frame the conflict so that it conforms to what we ultimately want to give our counterpart.
- Use calibrated questions starting with "what" and "how" to break confrontational frames and invite the other party into designing a solution that is in fact your solution. These will also help facilitate implementation of the solution.
- Be aware of the different negotiation styles (accommodators, assertives, and analysts) and bargaining techniques (extreme anchoring, strategic umbrage, de-escalating time-outs, Ackerman bargaining...)
- Look for pieces of knowledge that sit outside of our regular expectations that will increase our leverage (black swans). It is when we hear or see something that doesn't make sense, or something "crazy," when we should push forward and look for Black Swans.

Demonic racists being beaten up by a heroic black character was fun to watch, but I feel it kind of lacks the depth of human experience and drama that Watchmen the comic (or the movie) brought to the surface. stellar performances and some quirky and original stuff throughout it though, so if it gets more content with more original characters I would enjoy watching it.\n",
